## Rock Paper Scissors Game (Python)

This is a simple **Rock–Paper–Scissors** game written in **Python**, where a player competes against an imaginary friend (the computer). The game uses Python’s `random` module to generate the computer’s choice and keeps track of the player’s score across multiple rounds.

### How the Game Works

* The player chooses how many rounds they want to play.
* The player enters their name and the name of their imaginary friend.
* In each round, the player selects **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
* The computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, or scissors.
* The game compares both choices and declares a **win**, **loss**, or **draw**.
* The score increases for a win, decreases for a loss, and stays the same for a draw.
* After all rounds are completed, the final score is displayed.

### Features

* Random computer choices using the `random` module
* Score tracking across multiple rounds
* Clear win/lose/draw outcomes
* Simple and beginner-friendly Python logic
* Uses `time.sleep()` for better gameplay experience

### Technologies Used

* Python
* `random` module
* `time` module

This project is great for beginners who want to practice **conditional statements**, **loops**, and **user input** in Python.
